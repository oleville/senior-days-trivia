# Trivia Game

Trivia Game is a simple, interactive trivia implementation in Node.js using Express and SQLite3. Originally written by Elijah Verdoorn for Senior Days 2017, it can be adapted for other events as needed.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome, but this project will not be heavily worked on - it is considered a one-off project for a small event, not a long-term system. Emphisis is given to ease of use for the individual event, rather than to the generality of the system. If you'd like to use this as a base for another, more robust system, feel free to fork.
